## Overview

Cursor BBox provides an interactive, modal workflow for working with bounding volumes in Blender. The addon enables you to:

- **Place the 3D cursor** with pixel-perfect precision using raycasting
- **Create aligned bounding shapes** that automatically orient to your geometry
- **Mark specific faces** for selective bounding calculations
- **Add custom points** to include arbitrary locations in your calculations
- **Snap precisely** to vertices, edges, and face centers
- **Visualize everything** in real-time with color-coded feedback

Ideal for game development, collision mesh creation, architectural visualization, and any workflow requiring precise bounding volumes.

## Key Features

### Precision Cursor Placement
- **Raycast-based positioning**: Hover over any surface to place the cursor exactly where you need it
- **Face alignment**: Automatically align the cursor rotation to face normals
- **Edge-based orientation**: Use mouse wheel to cycle through edge alignments for perfect box orientation
- **Smart snapping**: Snap to vertices, edges, or face centers with a single keypress

### Multiple Bounding Shape Types
- **Interactive Box**: Create axis-aligned or face-aligned bounding boxes
- **Interactive Hull**: Generate convex hulls wrapping marked geometry
- **Interactive Sphere**: Create bounding spheres encompassing selected elements
- **Auto Fit Box**: One-click bounding box generation with current settings

### Advanced Marking System
- **Face marking**: Selectively mark faces to include only specific regions in calculations
- **Point marking**: Add custom points in 3D space to influence bounding calculations
- **Coplanar selection**: Automatically select connected coplanar faces with adjustable angle threshold
- **Visual feedback**: See marked faces highlighted in red, selected edges in green

### Flexible Configuration
- **Push offset**: Inflate or deflate generated geometry by a specified amount
- **Material system**: Automatically apply materials and colors to created objects
- **Collection management**: Organize generated objects into dedicated collections
- **Custom naming**: Configure naming patterns for different shape types

### Intuitive Controls
- **Modal workflow**: Stay in the tool for multiple operations without exiting
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Efficient key-based controls for all operations
- **Pie menu support**: Quick access via Shift+Alt+C
- **Real-time preview**: See bounding shapes before finalizing

## Use Cases

- **Game Development**: Create collision meshes, trigger volumes, and bounding boxes for physics
- **Architectural Visualization**: Generate precise bounding volumes for room calculations
- **3D Modeling**: Quickly create reference boxes and alignment helpers
- **Animation**: Set up precise pivot points and alignment guides
- **Technical Art**: Generate custom collision shapes and bounding volumes
